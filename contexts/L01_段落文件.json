I also enjoyed using online tools such as Kahoot! and Quizlet. There were some memorable moments, too. Once, my grandmother suddenly came into the room. She yelled at me to try her perfect beef noodles. My microphone was on, so the rest of the students heard it and started laughing. Another time, our teacher accidentally turned on a funny filter on her camera. She looked like an alien on the screen, so my classmates and I had another good laugh. Online lessons were fun sometimes, but I still found that I enjoyed seeing others in person more.",

However, I didn’t take the task seriously and skipped several group meetings. When the time came for me to step onto the stage, I was nervous and unprepared. Of course, I ruined the presentation and felt embarrassed in front of my classmates and teacher. We got a very low grade, and I felt depressed about letting the team down. The failure really upset　me, but I reflected on it and learned from my mistake. These days, this memory reminds me to prepare well and make sure that I always put my team first!",

The city’s streets were busy, and delicious foods like Korean barbecue and kimchi were all around me. I soon realized that the markets were a treat for my other senses since cheerful K-pop and colorful clothes were everywhere. I visited several old buildings and dressed up in traditional Korean clothes. While I was there, I tried to talk to locals. My Korean was poor, but fortunately, everyone was very friendly. At the end of the trip, I left with a lot of great memories, and I can’t wait to go back someday!",
